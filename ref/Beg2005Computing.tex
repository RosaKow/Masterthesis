{The model is relying on the large deformation approach of Christensen 1996.
 Smoothness is enforced by the norm $\|\cdot\|_V = \|L\cdot\|_{L^2}$ as a regularizer, where $L$ is a differential operator. It is shown that the length of the shortest path in the space of vector fields defines a metric. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the solution of the matching problem is derived. Details of the algorithm are explained: a semi-lagrangian method for integration of the flow equation; the choice of the differential operator $L = -\alpha\nabla^2 + \gamma\Id$ (Cauchy-Navier), where $L^\dag L f = g$. With periodic boundary conditions $L$ is self adjoint.
 In comparison to Christensen's algorithm it is shown that the vector fields vary much less over time.}
