{elastic matching strategy. Transformation $\varphi$ generated by vector field $u$ by $\varphi = id + u$. Goodness of transformation measured by cost $E_2(I_0, I_1, \varphi) = \|I_0\circ\varphi^{-1} - I_1\|_{L_2}$, regularization by $E_1(u) = \|Lu\|_{L_2}^2$, where $L$ is a differential operator. 
Limitation: No constraints for invertability }
