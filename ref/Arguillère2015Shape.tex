{
	First approach to constrained deformations. Good Introduction to mathematical model of shape space.
	The shape deformation analysis problem is specified as an infinite dimensional control problem with state and control constraints. The states are diffeomorphisms and the controls are vectorfields that both are subject to some constraints. Weel-posedness of the problem is proved in inf. dim.
	As an extension of the Pontyagin Maximum Principle optimal solutions are characterized by geodesics.
	An analysis of the infinite dimensional shape space problem with constraints as well as its finite dimensional approximation is given. Algorithms (Gradient descent, Augmented Lagrangian Method) are described.
